Privacy Policy for Lyra
Effective Date: October 15, 2025
Introduction
Welcome to Lyra. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to our mobile application, Lyra ("the App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about how the App functions.
This policy describes the types of information the App may access or collect, which is minimal, and our practices for using and disclosing that information. This policy applies to information the App accesses on your device, through third-party services integrated into the App, and not to information collected by any third-party websites you may visit by clicking links within the App.
By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
We have designed Lyra to be a privacy-focused application. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect or store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or physical address on our servers.
The information related to the App can be broken down into two categories:
1. Information Stored Locally on Your Device
The App uses your device's local storage (specifically, SharedPreferences) to save settings and remember your state for a better user experience. This data is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party. This includes:
The ID of the last played ambient and lo-fi sound so the App can restore its state when you reopen it.
Your preferred volume levels for music, ambient sounds, and lo-fi tracks.
For the local music library feature, the paths to audio files on your device that you have scanned. This allows the App to list your music without re-scanning every time.
The last playback position of your local music files.
Timestamps for how long an ambient sound remains unlocked after you have watched a rewarded advertisement.
2. Information Collected Automatically by Third-Party Services
The App integrates third-party services that are essential for its functionality. These services may collect certain information automatically as described below.
Google AdMob: The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. To show relevant ads and for their service to function, AdMob may collect and process data, which may include your device's advertising ID, IP address, device information (such as model and operating system), and general location data. This data is governed by Google's own privacy policies. We do not have access to or control over the information collected by AdMob.
You can review Google's policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Google Fonts: The App uses Google Fonts to display custom text styles. When the App runs, it may make requests to Google's servers to fetch these font files. This process may involve the collection of your IP address by Google, as is standard for most internet communications.
How We Use Information
Since we do not collect your personal information, we do not use it. The non-personal data collected by our third-party partners is used for the following purposes:
To Provide and Maintain the App: Local data storage allows the App to function as intended, providing a seamless audio playback experience.
To Display Advertisements: Google AdMob uses the data it collects to serve advertisements, including rewarded ads which allow you to unlock certain features in the App temporarily.
To Provide Core Visual Features: Google Fonts uses the data it collects to serve the font files necessary for the App's user interface.
App Permissions
To provide its full range of features, Lyra requires certain permissions on your device. Here is a description of why we need them:
Storage / Audio Access (Android 13+): This permission is fundamental to the App's local music player feature. It is required to scan your device for audio files (.mp3, .m4a) so they can be displayed and played within the App. The App only reads these files for playback; it does not modify, delete, or upload your personal files to any server.
Internet: This permission is required for two main purposes: (1) to fetch and display advertisements from Google AdMob, and (2) to download font files from Google Fonts. An internet connection is also required to access the library of ambient and lo-fi soundscapes.
Foreground Service & Wake Lock: These permissions are essential for providing an uninterrupted background audio experience. They allow the AudioService to continue playing soundscapes and music even when the App is not on the screen or when your device's screen is turned off.
Third-Party Links
The App may contain links to external sites, such as our Instagram and Discord communities. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children's Privacy
Lyra is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
